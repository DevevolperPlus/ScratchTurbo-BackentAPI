# To Do

## API

- [x] Endpoints should be seperate files
- [ ] Literally just remake all of the endpoints lmao
- [ ] Use MongoDB Database
  - [ ] Make a login system

## Projects

- [ ] Store project assets seperately
- [ ] Moderator removed projects should be "under review" (only accessible by ID) unless specified to fully delete

## Studios

- [ ] Allow studios to contain a list of project IDs
- [ ] Endpoint to get a page of a studio's projects
- [ ] Allow studio creators to add users that can add projects (Managers)
- [ ] Allow members to follow groups
- [ ] Allow studios to enable project adding for all people, followers, managers, or no one
- [ ] Allow studios to earn badges
- [ ] Allow studios to have ranks (can be used for enabling future features)
- [ ] Allow studios to OWN projects (the author is the studio, would allow managers to edit the project)

## Moderation

- [ ] Allow project assets to be moderated
- [x] Allow reports to be reviewed by mods

## Reporting

- [x] Add reporting projects and users with reasons
- [x] Save multiple reports from same user but don't count them
- [ ] Add report to user if they report too much content too quickly
- [x] Add report to user if they report the same content more than 3 times
- [ ] Automatically add a report to projects with auto-detected content(?)

## Ranking

- [x] Rank users based on if they have more than 3 projects and signed in 5 days ago
- [x] Only ranked users should be able to use Custom Extensions, Files, iframe, HTTP, Website Requests, Network, etc.
